          <h2 class="">Continued Optimism for swedish companies</h2>
          <p class="">The spring 2017 CF0 Survey reveals a clearly
          more positive sentiment among large Swedish companies. The overall CFO index
          shows, after a decline in the two latest surveys, a good jump to 58.2 from 54.1
          in 2016.<br> </p>
          <p>This is the highest level since spring 2011, Except for slightly reduced
          lending willingness, the other subindexes - business climate, nancial position and
          counterparty risk - improved significantly. In the last survey it was clear that CFO's
           took into account the still uncertain macro suituation after several major events during
          the course of 2016.</p>
